                        SOME SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN AS IS


Note that the source code for certain of the example shell scripts
have the "&lt;" and "&gt;" in place of angle brackets (< and >), or &amp; in
place of the ampersand (&). This is necessary for the Docbook SGML
conversion. If you plan to run these scripts from the enclosed source
files, then it will, of course, be necessary to restore the angle
brackets or ampersand.

                     &lt;           becomes  <
                     &gt;           becomes  >
                     &lt;&lt;       becomes  <<
                     &lt;&lt;&lt;   becomes  <<<
                     &gt;&gt;       becomes  >>
                     &amp;          becomes  &

In some of the below cases, only the comments are affected, and these scripts
require no fixups to execute as expected.


The following sed scriptlet will accomplish the fixup:

   sed -e 's/&lt;/</g' -e 's/&gt;/>/g' SCRIPT.sh > FIXED_SCRIPT.sh
